    # minDisp, maxDisp, P1factor, P2factor, preFilterCap, uniquenessRatio, dispDiff, speckleWindowSize, speckleRange,  windowSize
    # minDisp           -	Minimum possible disparity value. Normally, it is zero but sometimes rectification algorithms can shift images, so this parameter needs to be adjusted accordingly.
    # maxDisp           -	Maximum  possible disparity value minus minimum disparity. The total number of disparity values must be divisible by 16.
    # P1	            -   The first parameter controlling the disparity smoothness. See below.
    # P2	            -   The second parameter controlling the disparity smoothness. The larger the values are, the smoother the disparity is. P1 is the penalty on the disparity change by plus or minus 1 between neighbor pixels. P2 is the penalty on the disparity change by more than 1 between neighbor pixels. The algorithm requires P2 > P1 . See stereo_match.cpp sample where some reasonably good P1 and P2 values are shown (like 8*number_of_image_channels*blockSize*blockSize and 32*number_of_image_channels*blockSize*blockSize , respectively) [P1factor = 8, P2factor = 32].
    # preFilterCap	    -   Truncation value for the prefiltered image pixels. The algorithm first computes x-derivative at each pixel and clips its value by [-preFilterCap, preFilterCap] interval. The result values are passed to the Birchfield-Tomasi pixel cost function.
    # uniquenessRatio	-   Margin in percentage by which the best (minimum) computed cost function value should "win" the second best value to consider the found match correct. Normally, a value within the 5-15 range is good enough.
    # dispDiff   	    -   Maximum allowed difference (in integer pixel units) in the left-right disparity check. Set it to a non-positive value to disable the check.
    # speckleWindowSize	-   Maximum size of smooth disparity regions to consider their noise speckles and invalidate. Set it to 0 to disable speckle filtering. Otherwise, set it somewhere in the 50-200 range.
    # speckleRange	    -   Maximum disparity variation within each connected component. If you do speckle filtering, set the parameter to a positive value, it will be implicitly multiplied by 16. Normally, 1 or 2 is good enough.
    # windowSize        -	Matched block size. It must be an odd number >=1 . Normally, it should be somewhere in the 3..11 range.
